# CBT: Câ†”Brainfuck Transpiler

A source-to-source compiler suite for translating between Brainfuck and C. This project provides two tools:

- **bf2c**: Transpile Brainfuck code into equivalent C programs.  
- **c2bf**: Transpile C programs into Brainfuck.

Both tools include a robust set of optimizations and a suite of tests to ensure correctness.

## Features

- **Optimizations** for Brainfuck-to-C:
  - Run-length encoding of repeated operations
  - Pointer shift merging
  - Zero-loop detection (`[-]`)
  - Negation and multiplication loops
  - Scan-loop optimization for fast memory scans

- **Bidirectional conversion**:
  - Convert Brainfuck to readable, efficient C code
  - Convert (a subset of) C back to Brainfuck

- **Modes**:
  - I/O in `char` mode (standard Brainfuck semantics)
  - I/O in `number` mode (numeric input/output)

- **Comprehensive test suites**:
  - Classic programs: Hello World variants, ROT13, Bubble Sort, Fibonacci
  - Advanced demos: Universal Turing Machine, RNG, and more
